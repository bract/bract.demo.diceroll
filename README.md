# bract.demo.diceroll

A minimal demo web app for the Bract framework. The problem statement this app solves is as follows:

- Randomly pick a roll of dice on every web request
- Render the rolled dice in a visual text form
- Use [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure) for handling HTTP requests


## Usage

### Starting the server

You can build the app locally and run it as follows:

```shell
$ lein do clean, uberjar
$ java -jar target/uberjar/bract.demo.diceroll-0.1.0-standalone.jar -vf config.edn
```

Alternatively, you may want to run it as follows in development:

```shell
$ lein do clean, ring server-headless
```


### Browsing the application

In your web browser you can visit the following URLs:

http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:3000?char=@
http://localhost:3000/info


### REPL based development

```clojure
(require 'dev)
(dev/init)    ; initialize the app (also reload config files)
(dev/deinit)  ; de-initialize the app
(dev/reinit)  ; reload modified namespaces and re-initialize the app
(dev/start)   ; launch the web server with initialized app
(dev/stop)    ; stop the web server
```
